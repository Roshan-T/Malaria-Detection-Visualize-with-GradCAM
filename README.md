# Malaria-Detection-Visualize-with-GradCAM
This repository contains code for detecting malaria in cell images using Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping). Grad-CAM provides insights into which parts of the image are crucial for the model's prediction, enhancing interpretability.

This repository contains code for detecting malaria parasites in cell images using Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping). Grad-CAM helps visualize which parts of the image are important for the model's prediction, aiding in interpretability and understanding.

## Key Features

- Detect malaria parasites in cell images with interpretability.
- Visualize model predictions using Grad-CAM heatmaps.
- Utilizes PyTorch and OpenCV for implementation.
